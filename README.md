# projects
This is my first Git Repository.
This project is a beginner-friendly HTML and CSS sidebar navigation menu. It uses icons from Font Awesome and Google’s Poppins font to create a clean and modern design. The menu includes links like Gallery, Events, Store, Contact, and more, along with social media icons at the bottom. A hamburger button (☰) opens the menu, and a close button (×) hides it, making it interactive with just HTML and CSS—no JavaScript needed.
